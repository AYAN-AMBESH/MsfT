# MsfT

Media Server for Tulpa
I wanted to create my own server for watching movies and films thus,
I began on a journey to have something of my own created by my own hand
even tho there are open source projects such as nextcloud.

# MsfT journey

I began on a mesmerizing journey, started learning about which framework
would be better for the frontend or which one can I use for the backend

## Experimentation

Currently trying expressjs for API and react for frontend
Setting up webpack configuration for react.
